## Context 

The dataset we will explore in the project is named **“Speed Dating Experiment”**, as found on Kaggle.com. It was compiled by professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from Columbia Business School.

The data used in this project were gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.

See **References** for more information on the dataset and the experiment.

The dataset as well as the document explaining the meaning of the columns of the dataset (speed_dating_data_key) are included in the **data** folder of this project.

## Goal of the project

Understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together.
